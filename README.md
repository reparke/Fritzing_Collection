# ITP 348 Fritzing Parts

This is a collection of [Fritzing](https://fritzing.org/) parts used in [ITP 348 â€“ Introduction to Electronics and Wearables](https://reparke.github.io/ITP348-Physical-Computing), a course offered by the [Information Technology Program](https://itp.usc.edu/) in the [Viterbi School of Engineering](https://viterbischool.usc.edu/) at the [University of Southern California](https://www.usc.edu)

I did not create any of these parts, but I wanted to create an centralized place for students to access hard to find parts which are not included in Fritzing by default. I will give credit to the original authors and will remove anything if asked.
